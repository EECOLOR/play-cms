#Play CMS

The intention of this project is to provide CMS utilities as a library instead of a framework.

It is not close to completion.

## Motivation

I want a CMS that has the document metadata (or structure) as a starting point.

## Feedback

If you have feedback (suggestions, improvements, features, bugs, etc.), please create an issue.

## Plans

These are not necessarily in the correct order. 

- Make sure that the part I've written now is consistent, well documented and tested.
- Separate parts of the project into separate modules (testing, metadata, core)
- Create a ui module that can work with the metadata that is available (using scala-js)
- Support the concept of more complex property metadata (handling file upload, references to other documents)
- Add support for `static` information, also known as enumerations (for menu's etc.)
-
